<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Our UF Senior Design Team was tasked with automating the Florida Lottery Systemâ€™s current file storage process. The scope of this project included retrieving a file (Player, Retailer, or Game Focused) and having the creation of the file in a storage trigger a workflow to insert JSON objects into a SQL server. Our team explored two different methods to achieve this goal - Azure Logic Apps and Azure Data Factory. We noted the pros and cons of each platform and documented how to recreate these workflows.

<!-- BUILT WITH -->
## Built With

The following platforms were selected to build each pipeline:
* Azure Logic Apps
* Azure Data Factory
